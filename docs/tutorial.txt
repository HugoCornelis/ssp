Example 1: running a simple neuron model

First choose a neuron model.  Neurospaces comes with a library of
simple neuron models.  One of them is in the model library file

'tests/cells/tensizesp.ndf'

Normally, the model library is located in
'/usr/local/neurospaces/models/library'.

This is a simple passive 10 compartmental model (ie. without ionic
conductances).  To explore the model, use the command:

'neurospaces -g tests/cells/tensizesp.ndf'

Then, click the 'Explorer' button.  The neurospaces studio explorer
can be used to check the structure and parameter values of the model.
Specific as well as scaled values are displayed.

The neurospaces studio only allows to extract certain information from
a model, but right now, it does not allow to run the model.  To run a
model, use ssp.  To run the model 'tests/cells/tensizesp.ndf', use the
following command line:

'ssp --cell --model-filename tests/cells/tensizesp.ndf'


This tells ssp to use the buitin configuration with name 'cell' to run
single neuron models (doesn't matter how complex these models are).

The builtin configuration for a cell currently stimulates the neuron
model with a current injection of 2e-09 into the soma.  The calculated
membrane potential of the soma goes to a file with name
'output/tensizesp'.  This file is in ASCII format, with one column for
each calculated output.  The first column is the time step.
