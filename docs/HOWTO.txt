* installation
SSP is completely written in perl.  To get a unified installation
procedure with the other NS tools, it uses autotools for installation.
To install SSP, run these commands in the SSP source code directory,
as a normal user:

./configure
make
sudo make install


Additionally, if you have neurospaces and heccer installed, you can
also run this command:

make check

to see if all the components work well.
