    <h1>Integration Tests for SSP</h1>

    Below you find all the test specifications for SSP.  The tests
    consist mainly of integration tests with Neurospaces and Heccer.
    There is pretty much nothing to test for SSP (it is a
    <em>Simple</em> scheduler only).

    <p>

      These tests should give a broad idea of how working with SSP,
      Heccer and Neurospaces is like.  But don't let this discourage
      you to use any of the packages stand-alone or otherwise, e.g.
      integrating Heccer with a different modeling package.
