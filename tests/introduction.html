    <h1>Integration Tests for SSP</h1>

    These tests cover both stand-alone and integration functionality
    of SSP.  Heccer and the Neurospaces model container are used to
    test integration functionality.

    <p>

      These tests give an idea of integration of SSP, Heccer and the
      model container.  Integration with other packages is also
      possible.
