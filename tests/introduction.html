    <h1>Integration Tests for SSP</h1>

    Below you find all the test specifications for SSP.  The tests
    consist of ssp stand-alone as well as integration tests with
    Heccer only, and with the Neurospaces model container and Heccer.

    <p>

      These tests should give a broad idea of how working with SSP,
      Heccer and Neurospaces is like.  But don't let this discourage
      you to use any of the packages stand-alone or otherwise, e.g.
      integrating Heccer with a different modeling package.
